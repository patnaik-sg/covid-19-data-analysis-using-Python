# covid-19-data-analysis-using-Python
In this project I have preprocessed and merged datasets to calculate needed measures and prepare them for an Analysis. For the analysis, I have worked with the COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consists of the data related to the cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country. Also, I have used another dataset consisting of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe. I have merged these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.
